## Guide

Currently, there is no GUI for creating an embed link, but crafting the URL by hand shouldn't be difficult.

## URL Syntax

The following options should be added as [search parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) to the base URL (`https://code-block-embed.alexanderliu.dev/embed`)

Example: `https://code-block-embed.alexanderliu.dev/embed?code=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...&lines=1,2,3,4,5:6,7,8,9,10`

### `code`

Type: `URL` | **Required**

A URL that serves a raw text file (MIME type: text/plain).

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a GitHub (Gist), be sure to click the "Raw" button before copying the link.

### `fontSize`

Type: `number` | Default: 16

Font size in CSS pixels.

### `lines`

Type: `1,2,3,...,10:...:1,2,3`

Groups of lines are be separated with a colon (`:`).

Each group of lines is a comma separated list of numbers.

#### Examples

| Group(s)                   | Search Param                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Lines 1-5                  | `lines=1,2,3,4,5`               |
| Lines 1-5, Lines 6-10      | `lines=1,2,3,4,5:6,7,8,9,10`    |
| Lines 1-5 + 10, Lines 6-10 | `lines=1,2,3,4,5,10:6,7,8,9,10` |

### `showOnHover`
